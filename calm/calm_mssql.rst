### IMPORTANT: The blueprint is for Lab purposes only. Do not put this into production without modifying it to meet your organizations requirements, Nutanix Best Practices, and Microsoft SQL Best Practices.

Prerequisites:
**************
Certain prerequisites must be met before installation will succeed. The following must be configured:

- MSSQL installation requires CredSSP to be enabled on Karan host

On the SQL Service, set the variable "install_location" to external to download ISO from internet, or internal to download from a file share. If set to external, no further variables need to be modified.

If set to internal, you will need to fill out the following variables:

- file_share_user
- file_share_password
- file_server_ip
- file_share_name
- sql_iso_path (include path and iso file)
