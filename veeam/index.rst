Veeam Backup Proxy for AHV
--------------------------

Overview
++++++++

.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: **90 MINUTES**

  **Due to limited resources, this lab should be completed as a group.**

  This lab is built with an early Beta release of the Veeam Backup Proxy for AHV. You may encounter bugs or unimplemented features.

Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5 introduces support for Nutanix AHV through the Backup Proxy for AHV. The Backup Proxy is a Linux based virtual appliance that performs the role of a coordinator between the Nutanix platform and Veeam Backup & Replication. The Backup Proxy communicates with the AHV platform via Nutanix REST API, assigns necessary resources for backup and restore operations, reads/writes data from/to Nutanix storage containers and transports VM data to/from target Veeam backup repositories. The Backup Proxy is also responsible for job management and scheduling, data compression and deduplication, and applying retention policy settings to backup chains. Each Nutanix cluster leveraging Veeam for backup will require its own Backup Proxy VM.

In this exercise you will deploy and configure a Veeam Backup Server, deploy and configure a Veeam Backup Proxy, configure the connection to your Nutanix cluster and existing Veeam Backup & Replication infrastructure, and execute backup and restore operations.

Deploying Veeam Backup Server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Veeam Backup Server is the main management component in the Veeam backup infrastructure. The Veeam Backup Server is responsible for managing Veeam backup repositories that are used as a target for backup. The Veeam Backup & Replication Console is also used for granular VM restore operations such as restoring individual files, AD objects, Exchange mailboxes, and SQL/Oracle databases.

   :language: xml

.. note::

 The Unattend script will change the hostname to **VeeamServer**, join the **NTNXLAB.local** domain, and disable the Windows Firewall.

Select the **VeeamServer** VM and click **Power on**.

Once the VM has started, click **Launch Console**.

.. note::

  The VM can also be accessed via Microsoft RDP, enabling you to copy and paste text from the lab guide into the virtual machine.

Open **PowerShell** and execute the following command:

.. code-block:: posh
  :emphasize-lines: 1

  # Initializes and formats the 250GB disk added to the VeeamServer VM
  Get-Disk | Where partitionstyle -eq 'raw' | Initialize-Disk -PartitionStyle MBR -PassThru | New-Partition -AssignDriveLetter -UseMaximumSize | Format-Volume -FileSystem NTFS -NewFileSystemLabel "Backups" -Confirm:$false

.. Download the :download:`Veeam NFR license file<./veeam_availability_suite_nfr_6_6.lic>`.

Open the **Veeam Backup and Replication 9.5** Setup from the mounted .iso image. Click **Install**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/1.png

Select **I accept the terms in the license agreement** and click **Next**.

Click **Browse** and select the downloaded Veeam NFS license file. Click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/2.png

Review selected Program Features. Click **Next**.

If prompted for missing pre-requisite components, click **Install**. After completion, click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/4.png

Review configuration and click **Install**. While waiting for installation to complete, proceed to `Deploying Veeam Proxy Appliance`_.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/5.png

.. note::

  By default the Veeam Backup Server will deploy a Windows SQL Server Express database instance. A production Veeam deployment would use an external, highly available database. The installer will also create a Veeam Backup Repository to act as a backup target, by default it will select the volume with the most free space exposed to the backup server (the local 250GB disk added to the **VeeamServer** VM). For storing backups of Nutanix AHV VMs, Veeam currently supports the use of simple backup repositories, scale-out backup repositories, and ExaGrid appliances. HPE StoreOne and DellEMC DataDomain appliances are not currently supported.

Backing Up A VM
+++++++++++++++

Veeam Backup & Replication backs up Nutanix AHV VMs at the image level, just like VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V VMs. The Backup Proxy communicates with Nutanix AHV to trigger a VM snapshot, retrieves VM data block by block from Storage Containers hosting VMs, compresses and deduplicates the data, and writes to the Backup Repository in Veeamâ€™s proprietary format.

For AHV VMs, Veeam Backup & Replication utilizes the forever forward incremental backup method. During the initial backup, Veeam  copies the whole content of the VM and creates a full backup file (VBK) in the target location. The full backup file acts as a starting point of the backup chain. During subsequent backup sessions, Veeam copies only those data blocks that have changed since the previous backup, and stores these data blocks to an incremental backup file in the target location. Incremental backup files depend on the full backup file and preceding incremental backup files in the backup chain. The Backup Proxy integrates with Nutanix's Change Block Tracking (CBT) API to determine the changed portion of a VM's data to enable efficient, incremental backups.

In **Prism > VM > Table**, click **+ Create VM**.

.. note:: The second backup job should complete in less than 1 minute as there should be no significant delta between the initial full backup and the manually triggered incremental backup.

Restoring A VM
++++++++++++++

Using the Backup Proxy Web Console, you can restore a VM from backup to the Nutanix AHV cluster. At present, Veeam Backup & Replication does not support restoring from one Nutanix cluster to another. During the restore process, the Backup Proxy retrieves VM disk data from the backup on the Veeam Backup Repository, copies it to the Storage Container where disks of the original VM were located, and registers a restored VM on the Nutanix AHV cluster.

From the **Veeam Back Proxy Web Console**, select **Protected VMs** from the toolbar.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/20.png

Select an available Restore Point and click **Restore**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/21.png

Verify selection and click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/22.png

Select **Restore to a new location** and click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/23.png

Select **WS12-VeeamBackupTest** and click **Rename VM**. Select **Add suffix** and click **OK > Next**:

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/24.png

Click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/25.png

.. note::

  The ability to modify destination Storage Container or Disk Type is unavailable in this early access build.

Specify a reason for the restore operation and click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/26.png

Click **Finish** and monitor the restore operation until successfully completed.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/veeam/27.png

Verify the restored VM is available in Prism.

.. note::

  In addition to full VM restores, the **Veam Backup Proxy Web Console** can also restore individual virtual disks which can be mapped to any VM within the cluster. This functionality can be helpful if virtual disks containing data become corrupted (e.g. cryptolocker, virus, etc.).
